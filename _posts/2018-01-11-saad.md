# Setting up JADE (Multiagent system)

This section provides an overview of the JADE Architecture introducing the notions of
• Agent
• Container
• Platform
• Main Container
• AMS and DF
Figure 1 represents the main JADE architectural elements. An application based on JADE is made of a
set of components called Agents each one having a unique name. Agents execute tasks and interact by
exchanging messages. Agents live on top of a Platform that provides them with basic services such as
message delivery. A platform is composed of one or more Containers. Containers can be executed on
different hosts thus achieving a distributed platform. Each container can contain zero or more agents.
For instance, with reference to the figure 1 below, container "Container 1" in host Host 3 contains
agents A2 and A3. Even if in some particular scenarios this is not always the case, you can think of a
Container as a JVM (so, 1 JVM ==> 1 container ==> 0 or many agents). A special container called
Main Container exists in the platform. The main container is itself a container and can therefore contain
agents, but differs from other containers as it must be the first container to start in the platform and all
other containers register to it at bootstrap time and secondly, it includes two special agents: the AMS
that represents the authority in the platform and is the only agent able to perform platform management
actions such as starting and killing agents or shutting down the whole platform (normal agents can
request such actions to the AMS). The DF that provides the Yellow Pages service where agents can
publish the services they provide and find other agents providing the services they need. It should be
noticed that if another main container is started, as in host Host 4 in Figure 1, this constitutes a new
platform.

Installing Jade
In this section, the necessary per-requisites and installation guidelines are presented so that any future
expansions can be followed without difficulties. First it is necessary to have the latest supported version
of Java installed on the system.
Step 1. Download and install the Java SE SDK (version 7u5). 
Step 2. Download Eclipse (Juno release, Eclipse IDE for Java Developers package).
Step 3. Download and unzip JADE (version 4.2.0), resulting in the following directory structure:
 c:\jade-4.2.0\classes (from JADE-src-4.2.0.zip)
 c:\jade-4.2.0\demo (merge from from JADE-bin-4.2.0.zip and JADE-examples-4.2.0)
 c:\jade-4.2.0\doc (from JADE-doc-4.2.0.zip)
 c:\jade-4.2.0\lib (merge from JADE-bin-4.2.0.zip and JADE-src-4.2.0.zip)
 c:\jade-4.2.0\src (merge from JADE-src-4.2.0.zip and JADE-examples-4.2.0)

Starting JADE
We will now launch the JADE runtime and provides a brief description of the main features of the
JADE administration GUI. Launching the JADE runtime means creating a Container, such container
can then contain agents that can be started directly at container startup time or later on e.g. through the
JADE Management GUI. Moreover, being the first container in the platform, such container MUST be
the platform Main Container.
In the previous section, when mentioning Download Jade ver 4.2, we assumes that the following
packages were downloaded
 - The JADE binary distribution (JADE-bin-4.0.zip)
 - The JADE source distribution (JADE-src-4.0.zip)
 - The JADE examples distribution (JADE-examples-4.0.zip)
After unzipping the packages, the Jade directory structure should look something like figure 2:

When starting Jade, it should be notes that the Jade runtime can be launched in several ways. The
easiest way is to open a shell, move to the jade directory and type
java -cp lib\jade.jar jade.Boot -gui
You should see an output similar to that below.

--------------------------------------------
They key information to take from this console log is the information highlighted with yellow color.
The first one indicates the host (typically the local host) and port (1099 by default) where the Main
Container accepts incoming connections from other containers. It is possible to make Jade use a
different port by means of the -local-port <a-port> option. For instance to make the Main Container
accept incoming connections from other containers on port 1111 it would be sufficient to type the
command line below.
java -cp lib\jade.jar jade.Boot -gui -local-port 1111

Similarly it is possible to make JADE use a different host name/address with respect to that read from
the underlying network stack by means of the -local-host <host-name-or-address> option. This is
typically useful when dealing with network environments where hosts can be reached only by
specifying hostnames including the network domain (e.g. rvc.eng.miami.edu) as exemplified below
java -cp lib\jade.jar jade.Boot -gui -local-host rvc.eng.miami.edu
The second highlighted information is the name of the newly started Container (remember that the
Main Container is itself a Container). By default the name assigned to a Main Container is "Main
Container". You can explicitly assign a name to a Container (regardless of it is a Main or peripheral
Container) by means of the -container-name <a-name> option. Since we specified the -gui option, the
JADE Management Console depicted in figure 3 should also appear.

<img src="https://msaadsadiq.github.io/jade3.PNG" class="img-responsive" alt="">

In the left part of the Management Console you can see a tree showing that there is a Platform called
<Main-Container-host>:<Main-Container-port>/JADE (note that, by the fact the we launched a Main
Container, we actually created a Platform) that is composed of a single Container called Main
Container, that, on its turn, contains three agents:
 1. The ams i.e. agent management system
 2. The df i.e. directory facilitator or the Yellow pages service
 3. The rma i.e. Remote Management Agent, implementing the JADE Management Console
Looking at agent names we see that they have the form 

<local-name>@<platform-name>
It is possible to set a different platform name by means of the -platform-id <a-platform-name>
configuration option as in the command line below.
java -cp lib\jade.jar jade.Boot -gui -platform-id MyPlatform
If we did that, agents would have been called ams@MyPlatform, df@MyPlatform and
rma@MyPlatform respectively.
Testing the Hello World program
Now we will try to connect our Eclipse IDE to the Jade platform and try running the standard Hello
World program through the IDE. To achieve this we follow the below steps
Step 1. In Eclipse: created a new Java project named HelloWorldAgent.
Step 2. In Eclipse: navigated to menu Project > Properties; section Java Build Path; tab Libraries.
Step 3. Add (via “Add external JARs…” button) the two JAR files jade.jar and common-codec-1.3.jar
 (both from the lib directory).
Step 4. Add a new class named HelloWorldAgent to the project, specified jade.core.Agent as the parent
class.
Step 5. Override the setup method in the new class to say hello to the console. The finished agent class
should look as follows:
import jade.core.Agent;
 public class HelloWorldAgent extends Agent {
 protected void setup() {
 System.out.println("Hellod. I'm an agent.");
 }
 }
Step 6. Compile the project. Eclipse automatically compiles on the fly, so we didnt have to compile
explicitly with the javac command.
Step 7. Set/edit the CLASSPATH environment variable to contain the paths of the JADE JAR files, the
JADE class directory and the directory of the HelloWorldAgent:

 Set a “user variable”-type environment variable with name CLASSPATH and the following
value: %JADE_HOME%\lib\jade.jar;%JADE_HOME%\lib\common-codec\common-codec1.3.jar;c:\Users\Saad\workspace\HelloWorldAgent\bin;%JADE_HOME%\classes


Step 8. Start a up a console and boot the agent:
 java jade.Boot -agents Saad:HelloWorldAgent 
 
 
 Step 9. (optional) If Java gave an error, you either need to specify the -classpath parameter for the java
command or set the CLASSPATH environment variable.

Shutting Down the Platform
In order to shut the platform down, in the Management Gui, choose File --> Shut down Agent Platform
and then select Yes when prompted for confirmation. Next we will discuss about java swing and how it
has been used to develop the GUI. A short code snippet has been provided to inherit the swing libraries
and make a sample box. Anyone reproducing our simulation can run this code to test java swing and its
capabilities.
